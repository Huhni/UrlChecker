### Contribution

All help is welcomed! Feel free to suggest changes, create issues or even pull requests (from a simple typo fix to a full new module or even more!)

I don't have a coding style, but try to keep it similar to mine, with just a couple notes:

- Please write comments. No need to write full paragraphs each line, but at least a minor comment for functions and non-obvious blocks of code really help.
- Try to make small commits, when possible, I'll need to review you changes manually so help me understand it.
